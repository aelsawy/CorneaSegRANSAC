# README

This repository contains sample Matlab code for the segmentation of corneal layer interfaces using random sample consensus (RANSAC) method with polynomial models. This code is intended to be a fast way to segment corneal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images with high SNR, e.g., the OCT image shown in the following figure.
